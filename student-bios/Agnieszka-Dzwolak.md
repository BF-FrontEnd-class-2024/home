I come from Poland but I have been living in Belgium for 5 years. I completed my
master's degree in Land and Real Estate Management and worked for 8 years in
Logistic in Poland and Belgium.

I decided to completely change careers and start my journey in Web Developement.
I feel passionate about building websites and I'm super motivated.

My hobbies:

- travel 🌴,
- cross-fit :,
- ice-swimming ❄️🏊‍♀️,
- food,
- singing under the shower 🚿🎤,
